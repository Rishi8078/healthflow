# Changelog

All notable public changes to Healthflow are recorded here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `sleep_start` and `sleep_end` timestamp sensors for the latest valid
  reconciled sleep session. They come from the session's physical interval,
  which Healthflow already reads to pick the latest session.

### Safety And Compatibility

- No new Google requests, data types, or OAuth scopes. No reauthorization is
  required.
- The normalized history store gains two optional (additive) summary fields at
  schema version 3. Existing rows load with both values as `None` and are not
  rewritten. Days synced after upgrading store the timestamps.
- Existing config entries, entity IDs, and Recorder history are preserved.

## 1.1.1-beta.1 - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Added bounded, memory-only performance measurements for current refresh and
  backfill work. Each person retains only the latest 12 operations.
- Added an allowlisted performance summary to downloadable diagnostics with
  operation duration, Google request count and elapsed time, history read and
  write timing, coordinator lock wait, outcome, backfill state, and enabled
  capability names.
- Added README and troubleshooting instructions for collecting one hour of CPU
  history and diagnostics for every configured person.

### Safety And Compatibility

- This beta is diagnostic instrumentation, not a claimed CPU fix. It is
  intended to identify which Healthflow phase, if any, aligns with reported
  15-minute CPU spikes.
- No new sensors, polling intervals, Google requests, background tasks,
  Recorder rows, or persistent performance records were added.
- Performance diagnostics contain no health values, OAuth material, Google
  identifiers, request parameters, raw payloads, or exception messages.
- Existing config entries, existing entity IDs, normalized history, and Home
  Assistant Recorder history are preserved.
- No OAuth reauthorization is required for this beta.

### Affected-User Test Procedure

1. Install the beta completely through HACS and complete the existing single
   post-download restart sequence.
2. Confirm every Healthflow person is loaded, then allow four normal
   15-minute polling cycles without repeatedly running manual refresh.
3. Capture Home Assistant CPU history covering the same hour.
4. Download and review diagnostics for every configured person.
5. Include the Healthflow and Home Assistant versions, installation type,
   hardware, configured-person count, enabled options, backfill status, normal
   CPU use, and spike level in the support report.
6. Remove health values, credentials, account addresses, raw Google payloads,
   unredacted storage, and personal health screenshots before sharing.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added Total calories burned today using Google's `total-calories`
  `dataPoints:dailyRollUp` operation.
- Added Sleep time in bed, Time to fall asleep, and Time in bed after waking
  from Google's existing sleep authorization.
- Expanded optional body measurements with Body-fat percentage and Height
  alongside Weight. These entities are disabled by default and use the existing
  health-metrics permission.
- Added per-person optional nutrition support for Calories consumed today and
  Water consumed today through `nutrition-log` and `hydration-log`.
- Added optional paired-device Battery level and Paired-device last Google sync
  entities for devices returned by Google.

### Fixed

- Corrected the Total calories daily-rollup request so its page count remains
  within Google's maximum query-duration validation.
- Added a bounded historical Height lookup for sparse measurements outside the
  normal 90-day body-history window.
- Preserved existing entity IDs, configuration entries, normalized history,
  baseline authorization, and Home Assistant Recorder history during upgrades.
- Lowered routine automatic refresh diagnostics from warning to debug while
  keeping the operator-requested availability probe at info.
- Kept optional capability failures isolated so declining nutrition or paired
  device access does not stop baseline activity, health, or sleep sensors.
- Hardened public-release history scanning without allowing unrelated local
  branches to block a release from the checked-out public branch.

### Privacy

- Nutrition and paired-device support remains read-only and opt-in per person.
- Healthflow does not retain food names, raw nutrition logs, MAC addresses,
  raw paired-device resource IDs, device feature lists, OAuth credentials, or
  raw Google API payloads.
- Nutrition has no historical backfill. Normalized Calories consumed today and
  Water consumed today begin with the first successful authorized refresh.

### Upgrade And Nutrition Authorization

1. Install `1.1.0` completely through HACS, then restart Home Assistant once.
2. Do not delete or re-add any existing Healthflow person.
3. For each person who wants nutrition sensors, open that existing Healthflow
   entry, select **Configure**, and enable `include_nutrition`.
4. Complete **Reauthenticate** for that same entry and same Google account.
5. On Google's consent screen, approve Google Health nutrition access
   (`googlehealth.nutrition.readonly`) in addition to the baseline permissions.
6. Run the Healthflow refresh action or wait for the next 15-minute poll.
7. Repeat the option and consent steps independently for each household member.

Baseline sensors continue without nutrition reauthorization. If nutrition
permission is declined, only Calories consumed today and Water consumed today
remain unavailable.

## 1.1.0-beta.2 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Corrected the Total calories burned today daily-rollup request so its page
  count remains within Google's maximum query-duration validation.
- Added a bounded historical Height lookup when no measurement exists in the
  normal body-history window. This retrieves the latest sparse measurement
  without extending every body-metric backfill request.
- Restricted the public-history privacy scanner to commits reachable from the
  checked-out release branch. Unrelated local branches no longer block a clean
  release, while the full patch, path, blob, credential, identity, and PNG
  checks remain active for release history.

### Upgrade And Test

- Install the beta completely through HACS, then restart Home Assistant once.
- Enable the disabled-by-default Total calories burned today and Height entities
  if needed, run the Healthflow refresh action, and verify their live Google
  values before this beta is promoted.
- Existing entity IDs, normalized history, configuration entries, and OAuth
  authorization are preserved.

## 1.1.0-beta.1 - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added Total calories burned today and detailed sleep-timing entities from the
  existing baseline Google Health authorization.
- Expanded `include_body_measurements` to Weight, Body-fat percentage, and
  Height. All three body entities are created disabled by default in the Home
  Assistant entity registry.
- Added per-person `include_nutrition` support for Calories consumed today and
  Water consumed today through the optional
  `googlehealth.nutrition.readonly` scope. This release starts normalized
  nutrition with the first successful opt-in refresh and has
  no historical nutrition backfill.
- Added per-person `include_paired_devices` support through the optional
  `googlehealth.settings.readonly` scope. Each current Google paired tracker or
  scale can expose Battery level and Paired-device last sync entities.

### Changed

- Upgrades preserve existing config entries and baseline-only authorizations. New
  optional permissions are requested through reauthorization on the same
  person's entry, and declining one leaves baseline sensors working.
- Added the eight static person entity keys without changing existing entity
  identities. Paired battery and sync entities are created dynamically per
  person and paired-device identity.
- Clarified that setup accepts a person name and derives the slug used for
  entity and action identity, while normalized history storage is owned by the
  Home Assistant config-entry ID.
- Extended normalized history with total calories, sleep timing, body fat,
  height, and current-day nutrition fields. Paired-device metadata remains
  current only and is excluded from normalized history.
- Moved automatic redacted refresh diagnostics from warning to debug logging.
  The explicitly requested optional-data availability probe now logs at info.

### Privacy

- Food names, raw nutrition logs, MAC addresses, raw paired-device resource
  IDs, and device feature lists are excluded from normalized storage and
  diagnostics.
- Disabling an optional capability stops future requests. Nutrition values
  already normalized for prior opt-in days and Home Assistant Recorder states
  are not automatically erased; removal and purge decisions remain explicit
  operator actions.

### Upgrade

- Update normally without deleting or re-adding the integration. Baseline
  sensors require no reauthorization.
- Enable nutrition or paired devices from each person's options, then complete
  Google reauthorization for that same person. Repeat per person.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Restored current-day active-zone minutes, floors, sedentary minutes, and
  heart-rate-zone minutes when Google has reconciled interval records but has
  not yet published the corresponding daily rollups.
- Kept Google's daily rollups authoritative whenever they are available, while
  retaining the reconciled interval fallback only for an incomplete current day.
- Added value-free diagnostics that report response counts and metric
  availability without logging health values, OAuth credentials, identifiers,
  or raw API payloads.

### Verified

- Confirmed the fallback against live Google Health data for three enrolled
  people. Active-zone, sedentary, and heart-rate-zone sensors populated for all
  three; floor sensors populated where Google returned current-day floor
  records. The reference person's values remained populated after a second
  manual refresh.
- Confirmed the complete automated suite with 610 passing tests, Ruff, Python
  compilation, and Home Assistant configuration validation.

### Upgrade

- No configuration, OAuth, entity ID, or history migration is required.
- Install the update completely through HACS, then restart Home Assistant once.
- After restart, use the Healthflow refresh action or wait for the next
  15-minute poll.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Accepted Google Health daily rollup responses that end at `23:59:59` on the
  same civil date, matching Google's documented response format.
- Preserved support for daily rollups that end at midnight on the following
  civil date.

### Upgrade

- No configuration, OAuth, entity ID, or history migration is required.
- Install the update completely through HACS, then restart Home Assistant once.
- After restart, use the Healthflow refresh action or wait for the next
  15-minute poll.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Corrected the Google Health `dailyRollUp` request to use the documented
  `CivilDateTime` structure. This restores active-zone minutes, floors, sedentary
  minutes, and heart-rate-zone minute rollups when Google provides source data.
- Accepted daily-rollup boundaries where Google omits the optional midnight time
  object.

### Upgrade

- No configuration, OAuth, entity ID, or history migration is required.
- Install the update completely through HACS, then restart Home Assistant once.
- Daily oxygen saturation and daily VO2 max remain daily summary metrics and may
  appear after Google finishes processing that day's source data.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Reduced core history backfill requests from 31-day to seven-day windows so high-volume
  heart-rate history remains below Google Health pagination safety limits.
- Prevented an oversized history window from repeatedly retrying without advancing its
  durable backfill checkpoint.

### Upgrade

- No configuration or OAuth changes are required. Install the update completely through
  HACS, then restart Home Assistant once.
- Existing person entries, entity IDs, recorder history, and normalized integration history
  are preserved.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-22

### Added

- User-owned Google OAuth through Home Assistant Application Credentials with exactly
  three read-only Google Health scopes.
- Independent person-scoped config entries, stable entity identities, reauthentication,
  and per-person body-measurement opt-in.
- Core activity, sleep, workout, heart, source, synchronization, and backfill entities.
- Expanded active-zone, VO2 max, oxygen, respiratory, floors, sedentary, heart-zone, and
  optional weight entities.
- Fifteen-minute current polling, five-minute manual-refresh cooldown, resumable bounded
  history backfill, normalized WebSocket history, and value-free optional-data probing.
- Partial metric-group recovery, explicit unavailable-versus-zero semantics, redacted
  diagnostics, and strict normalized history validation.
- HACS metadata, public brand assets, installation and operations documentation, security
  policy, contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and structured issue forms.

### Privacy

- No hosted/shared OAuth backend.
- Raw Google responses, individual samples, OAuth credentials, Google identifiers, and
  personal health values are excluded from persisted integration history and diagnostics.
- Weight collection is disabled unless each person explicitly opts in.
