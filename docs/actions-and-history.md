# Actions and History

Healthflow exposes two Home Assistant actions and one authenticated WebSocket command.
All interfaces select a loaded config entry by the stable person slug that
Healthflow derives from `person_name` during enrollment. The setup UI asks
for **Person name**, not a slug. The derived slug is used for entity identity
and service or action targeting within that entry. Normalized history remains
owned by the Home Assistant config-entry ID. The config entry title does not
reliably display the derived slug, and the runtime does not expose it in
entity attributes or diagnostics.

To find the slug, open the Healthflow device and inspect an entity that still has its
default entity ID, such as Steps today. Its stable unique ID and default entity ID end in a
known runtime key. The slug is the prefix before a known key such as `_steps_today`: for
example, the default entity ID shape is `sensor.<person_slug>_steps_today`, and the stable
unique ID shape is `<person_slug>_steps_today`. A manually renamed entity ID may hide this
pattern, so use another unrenamed Healthflow entity or inspect the stable unique ID with
trusted Home Assistant entity-registry tooling. Do not guess a slug or post it publicly.

## `healthflow.refresh`

Use this action to request current data for one loaded person.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `person` | Yes | Exact stable person slug |

The action uses a five-minute manual cooldown. Calls during the cooldown return the
current coordinator snapshot without another Google poll. The normal scheduled poll runs
every 15 minutes. Manual refresh does not bypass OAuth failures, validation, partial-group
handling, or redaction.

This action requests Healthflow API refresh time; it does not command a
wearable or mobile application to sync with Google. A dynamic paired device's
`last_device_sync` is the separate Fitbit mobile-device sync time reported by
Google.

## `healthflow.probe_optional_data_types`

This advanced diagnostic action checks whether candidate Google Health data types are
available before the integration adds permanent polling for them.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `person` | Yes | Exact stable person slug |
| `days` | No | Integer lookback from 1 through 14; default 7 |

The response contains each data type's status, raw count, all-source count, wearable
count, and normalized platform labels. It never returns health values, OAuth credentials,
Google identifiers, individual samples, or raw Google API payloads. `requires_rollup`
means the candidate cannot be checked with list or reconcile operations; it does not prove
that the account has no data. The probe runs only on request and does not change the
normal 15-minute polling set.

## `healthflow/history`

The history interface is an authenticated Home Assistant WebSocket command intended for
dashboards and other trusted Home Assistant clients. It returns locally stored normalized
daily summaries, not Home Assistant recorder states and not Google responses.
The `person` slug selects the currently loaded config entry; the command then
reads the normalized store keyed by that entry's config-entry ID.

## Request fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Exactly `healthflow/history` |
| `person` | string | Exact stable person slug |
| `start_date` | string | Inclusive ISO calendar date |
| `end_date` | string | Inclusive ISO calendar date |
| `metrics` | list of strings | Optional allowlist; omitting it returns default core metrics |

Core history queries are bounded to the provider's 20-year history window. Queries that
request any expanded metric are limited to at most 90 calendar dates. Dates must be
canonical `YYYY-MM-DD` strings and the start must not follow the end.

### Core metric keys

`steps`, `fitbit_steps`, `distance_m`, `active_energy_kcal`, `exercise_minutes`,
`sleep_minutes`, `resting_heart_rate`, `average_heart_rate`, `minimum_heart_rate`,
`maximum_heart_rate`, `hrv_ms`, `total_energy_kcal`,
`sleep_period_minutes`, `sleep_onset_minutes`, `sleep_after_wake_minutes`,
`source`, `complete`, and `updated_at`.

The default set contains all core keys except `updated_at`.

### Nutrition metric keys

`nutrition_energy_kcal` and `hydration_ml` are returned only when
`include_nutrition` is enabled and the person's token contains
`googlehealth.nutrition.readonly`. Otherwise both values are `null`, even if a
prior normalized row contains them.

Nutrition has no historical backfill in this release. Normalized nutrition
history starts with the first successful opt-in refresh and accumulates one
current-day summary at a time.

### Expanded metric keys

`active_zone_minutes`, `vo2_max`, `vo2_estimated`, `cardio_fitness_level`,
`oxygen_average`, `oxygen_lower_bound`, `oxygen_upper_bound`,
`oxygen_standard_deviation`, `daily_respiratory_rate`, `sleep_respiratory_rates`,
`sleep_respiratory_standard_deviation`, `sleep_respiratory_signal_to_noise`, `floors`,
`sedentary_minutes`, `heart_zone_minutes`, `heart_zone_thresholds`,
`heart_zone_calories`, `weight_kg`, `body_fat_percentage`, and `height_m`.

`weight_kg`, `body_fat_percentage`, and `height_m` are returned as unavailable
unless `include_body_measurements` is enabled for that person. Mapping and
tuple values are converted to JSON-safe objects and lists. Every record
includes its normalized date. Unsupported metrics, unknown people, invalid
dates, and excessive ranges return a generic command error without exposing
private data.

Paired-device battery and sync metadata are not supported history metrics
because paired devices are current metadata only. Requests for
`battery_level`, `last_device_sync`, or any paired identifier are rejected as
unsupported instead of exposing current device metadata through daily
history.

## Recorder history

Home Assistant may separately retain entity state history through Recorder. Recorder
retention, exclusion, purge, and backup policies are controlled by Home Assistant and are
not changed by this integration. Removing a config entry or opting out of weight does not
automatically erase recorder history already stored by Home Assistant.

The same boundary applies to nutrition and paired entities. Disabling an
option stops future requests but does not purge Home Assistant Recorder
history or backups. Nutrition values already normalized during opt-in remain
in the private daily store; paired metadata never enters that store.
